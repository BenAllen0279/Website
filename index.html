    <p class="colorwhite">A little about myself.</p>
        <p class="colorwhite">My name is Ben, I've been playing guitar for around about nine years or so (10 upon halloween as it was then when I recieved my guitar as a gift.), I'm entirely self taught and love exploring all kinds of genres. Be them hardly related to songs that don't use guitars, to songs that do. making music takes talent and it's a talent I can deeply respect, because it takes time and effort and ultimately a lot of skill. My personal favourite genre to listen and to play would lean towards heavy metal, due to how it takes from all different kinds of genres. Did you know that the blues are prevelent in many famous metal songs? For example on the intro, chorus and bridge for "Enter Sandman" - Metallica 1991 (The Black Album) all use variations on blues scales. A simillar effect can also happen with Rap and Metal, when combined the genre is called Nu Metal and hasn't really been active since the early to late 90's, however many people who enjoy rap will often enjoy metal due to similar and prevelant themes in both. The same can be said for Metal and Classical music. Many people who enjoy Metal will enjoy Classical music too and it's often been said that Metal is Classical music with electricity.</p>

        <p class="largewhite"> What does guitar music mean to me?</p>
       <p class="colorwhite"> This can be a tricky question to answer because it can change and differ on days. However at the time of writing guitar music to me is a means of expression, most humans have an innate ability to connect with music and I believe that music brings people together from all walks of life no matter what creed or belifes you follow. Music can be enjoyed by all, wether you listen for the message behind the song, or simply just like the flow: Theres no wrong way to listen to music.</p>
