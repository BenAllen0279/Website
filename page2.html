<h1>Where to start as a beginner?</h1>
 
 
    <p class="colorwhite">
        Starting to play guitar can be very intimidating, I remember when I first started that I felt adrift in an open ocean with land not in sight. But you don't have to let this be you! It's important that you learn the basics of playing, how to hold your guitar properly, the parts of the guitar i.e. The neck, knut, frets, string order, tuning pegs, ect ect. Once you have that down, it's time to learn to play! I personally recommend starting with Tableture and learning how to read it, it's also known as "Tabs". Tabs differ from sheet music as they're numbers along a dotted line, each number is what fret to play and the order to play them in. Where the number is on the page defines which string to pluck. When there is more than one number in one line stacked up on each other that means you should play them all in one go, you typically see this with Bar Chords and Power Chords. And just like that, your ready to start your adventure! Remember to listen to music and train your ear the faster you can play by ear, the better off you will be for it!
